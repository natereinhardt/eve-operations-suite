# EOS: Eve Operations Suite (The UI)

An app to maintain fleet operations within Eve Online.


###THIS APP IS A WORK IN PROGRESS###
I have a plan for it but it will take me a long time to get it there. The tech stack is new to me and I am learning as I go along. I plan to slowly develop it when I have time. 


Im starting this project from scratch with no generators to hopefully grasp a better understanding of the stack im using. Its going to be far from perfect and I expect to refactor the code base many times as it evolves

###Tech Stack###
- AngularJs 2?!!?!?


###TO RUN###

*Assuming you have node installed

Travel to the base directory of this project where you saved it.
####Setup####

####Running####
